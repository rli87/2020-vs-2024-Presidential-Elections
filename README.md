# 2020-vs-2024-Presidential-Elections

Version: 11/15/2024

This is one of the first comprehensive comparisons available on the internet studying vote differences across all states 2020 vs. 2024.

Although the ballots have not finally closed yet, I compiled this comprehensive vote count dataset by scraping vote counts and shares for all 50 states. You can access the R codes here for data analysis strategies, or the 'wide_sum.csv' file for the finalized visualized tables.

The 2020 votes data is from MIT Elections Lab and the 2024 voting data is scraped from BBC.
